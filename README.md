# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This application allows the user to enter a desired location in the search bar, click search, and see both the current weather and 5-day-forecast information. This project intends to display the skills I've learned in Javascript, namely get requests, fetch requests, bootstrap, and local storage. Throughout development, I learned how to use both the geocoding API and openweathermap API, both hosted on the openweathermap webpage. I learned how to use information from one fetch request (location data) to complete two other fetch requests (current weather and 5-day forecast) within the same application, and display those on the screen.

## Installation

This webpage can be accessed on Github Pages, at the link:

## Usage

Once the webpage has been accessed using the Installation guidelines above, the user will see the webpage, matching the screenshot below. The user can edit the text in the search bar to match their preferred city name where they would like to retrieve weather data. For increased accuracy, the user will enter in the following format: (city name), (state code), (country code). Then the user can click search. At this time, the fetch requests will run and the weather information gathered by these commands will be populated in the 'current weather' and 'forecast' boxes on the screen. For clarity, the city name that matches the user search will be populated at the top of the 'current weather data' information.
